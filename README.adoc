= FaceRecognitionBackend

Backend for a small 'Face Recognition project'.

Basically it keeps information about 'users'
and integrates with another python service with https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet[facenet].

Python service provides encoding information by photo.

This backend service registers users,
uses facenet model for calculating encodings,
keeps these encodings,
and provides an ability to compare encodings - to find user by photo taken in mobile app.
